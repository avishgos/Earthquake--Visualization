# Earthquake--Visualization

Developed a project on " Data Visualization on Significant Earthquakes " where I have taken data from the year 1995 to 2015 and have done a visualization
on places where earthquakes have occurred on earth, plotted many graphs like bar graphs which makes it easy to read data, and then plotted
the data frame in a world map with a Location marker.
